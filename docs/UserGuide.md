5. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`show`**` today` : lists all tasks scheduled for today
   * **`add`**` buy eggs by 5pm today` : 
     remind yourself to get some eggs by 5pm today
   * **`delete`**` 1` : deletes the first task shown in the to-do list
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>

#### Adding a task : `add`
Adds a task, deadline, event or a floating task to the list. <br>
Format: `add TASKNAME [at/from START_TIMEDATE] [by/to END_TIMEDATE] [r/RECURRING] [p/PRIORITY]`

> * For tasks and events, at least one of the two TIMEDATE values must be included.<br>
> * For floating tasks, none of the TIMEDATE values are specified.<br>
> * If the taskname contains keywords like "add", the user can enter it using the escape character '\'.
* `add Shop \at Topshop at 5pm`
> * Priority must be low/med/high. If priority is not specified, default priority of low is set.
> * Recurring frequency can be either of daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.
> * If START_TIMEDATE exceeds END_TIMEDATE, the addition of task will not be successful.
> * Floating tasks cannot be added as a recurring one. In the event that this is attempted, the floating task will be added but the recurring frequency entered will be ignored. So the task will be added as a non-recurring one.

Examples: 
* `add Buy eggs at 5pm 13/09/2016 r/weekly p/high`
* `add Meeting from 13/09/2016 5pm to 13/09/2016 7pm p/med`
* `add Pay bills by 13/09/2016 5pm`
* `add Do laundry p/low`

#### Displaying tasks : `show`
Displays tasks and their indexes in the specified category.<br>
Format: `show [TYPE]`

> * TYPE can be replaced with p/high, p/med, p/low, complete, incomplete, all, overdue, floating, today, tomorrow, or any specific date.
> * If TYPE is not specified and only `show` is entered, then the incomplete tasks are shown as the default view.
> * p/high, p/med, p/low stand for tasks with high priority, medium priority and low priority respectively.
> * Except for show complete, all other inputs for TYPE will only display the incomplete tasks, i.e., the tasks which have not been marked as done.
> * The user can also enter the keywords today, tomorrow, floating and overdue without specifying the show keyword to quickly retrieve the corresponding tasks.

Examples:
* `show incomplete`<br>

> * Lists all incomplete tasks

* `show p/high`<br>

> * Lists all tasks marked as high priority

* `show tomorrow`<br>

> * Lists all tasks for tomorrow

* `show 30/10/2016`<br>

> * Lists all the tasks scheduled on 30th October, 2016

#### Searching for tasks : `find`
Lists tasks whose names match the given input.<br>
Format: `find SEARCHSTRING`

> * The search is case insensitive. e.g `buy` will match `Buy`
> * Wild cards can be indicated with an asterisk `*` e.g. `B* eggs` will match `Buy eggs`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * Tasks containing the entered text will be matched e.g. `Buy` will match `Must buy eggs`

Examples: 
* `find b*y`<br>

> * Returns both `buy` and `buy eggs`

#### Deleting a task : `delete`
Deletes the specified task.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX/TASKNAME`

> * Deletes the task at the specified index
> * If TASKNAME is entered instead, and only one task matches the name, it will be deleted. 
> * If TASKNAME is entered, and there are multiple tasks with matching names, then they are all displayed along with their indices. In this scenario, the user can only proceed with deletion using the index of the appropriate task.

Examples:
* `delete 1`

> * Deletes task at index 1

* `delete b*y`

> * If only 1 task matches the entered text, it is deleted. Otherwise, the tasks matching `b*y*` will be listed for the user to choose from.

#### Updating a task : `update`
Updates information for a task referred by its index.<br>
Format: `update INDEX [TASKNAME] [at/from [START_TIMEDATE] [to/by [END_TIMEDATE]] [r/RECURRING] [p/PRIORITY]`

> * Replaces the entered information for the task at the specified index
> * If updated START_TIMEDATE exceeds END_TIMEDATE of the task, the update will not be successful

Examples:
* `update 1 at 13/09/2016 5pm`<br>

> * `Meeting from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm` will be replaced with `Meeting at 13/09/2016 5pm`

* `update 1 from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm`

> * `Meeting at 13/09/2016 5pm` will be replaced with `Meeting from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm`

* `update 1 p/high`<br>

> * The priority of the task at index 1 is updated to high.

#### Marking a task as complete : `done`
Marks a task as complete.<br>
Format: `done INDEX/TASKNAME`

> * Marks the task at the specified index as complete
> * If TASKNAME is entered, tasks are sought out in the same way the `find` command does. If only one task is found, it will be marked as done. Otherwise, matching tasks and their indices are displayed. The user can then proceed with marking a task as complete using the index of the appropriate task.

Examples:
* `done 1`
* `done b*y`

Format: NIL

> * If no commands match the current text, nothing will happen
> * If 2 or more commands match the current text, nothing will happen

Examples:
* Pressing TAB/spacebar after entering `de` will complete `delete`
* Pressing TAB/spacebar after entering `u` will do nothing, as both `undo` and `update` match `u`
* Pressing TAB/spacebar after entering `un` will complete `undo`
