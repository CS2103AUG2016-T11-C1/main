#### Fantastical (studied by Fionna Tong)

Strengths:

1. Uses powerful natural language for adding events with or without date.
2. Keeps the calendar view and list of upcoming events active.
3. Full calendar window with options to view by day, week, month or year while adding events
4. Automatically shows public holidays in the calendar for easier scheduling.
5. Able to sync and integrate with existing calendars e.g. local, Google and Exchange - this allows Jim to access his calendar from both his work and personal laptops.
6. Supports different calendar sets.

Weaknesses:

1. Does not help look for a free slot to schedule an event.
2. Does not have a way to "block" multiple time slots for an event when the timing is uncertain, and release the blocked slots when the time is finalised.
3. Allows scheduling for different events at the same time without prompting the user.
4. No CLI.

#### Displaying tasks : `show`
Displays tasks and their indexes in the specified category.<br>
Format: `show TYPE`

> * TYPE can be replaced with p/high, p/med, p/low, complete, incomplete, all, overdue, floating, today, tomorrow, or any specific date.
> * p/high, p/med, p/low stand for tasks with high priority, medium priority and low priority respectively.
> * Except for show complete, all other inputs for TYPE will only display the incomplete tasks, i.e., the tasks which have not been marked as done.

Examples:
* `show p/high`<br>

> * Lists all tasks marked as high priority

* `show tomorrow`<br>

> * Lists all tasks for tomorrow

* `show 30/10/2016`<br>

> * Lists all the tasks scheduled on 30th October, 2016
