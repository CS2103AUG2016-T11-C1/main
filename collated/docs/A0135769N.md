### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklitst/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 3`.

<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskListChangedEvent` when the Task list data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task List data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task list data in xml format and read it back.

#### Use case UC06 - Set storage directory

**MSS**

Precondition: The storage file has to exist in order for the directory shift to take place. 

Guarantees:  
* The corresponding file path will be updated to its new value. 

1. The user enters the file path, indicating the folder in which he wants to save the data.
2. When the user enters the file path, he should indicate the file name by which he wants to update the directory:
   e.g  Users/James/Desktop/[filename].xml
3. The user can only specify the directory in which the file needs to be moved to. In this case, the file will be moved with default filename (tasklist.xml).   
4. System will process the file path and will create a copy of the file in the new directory.
5. File in the old directory will be removed.

#### Use case UC09 - Help Command (Command Summary)

**MSS**

Precondition: help command has to be entered correctly.

Guarantees:  
* Command summary browser window will appear.

1. Use enters 'help' in command box.
2. A browser window with a list of Command summary will open.
3. Press ENTER key to close the browser and return to the command line interface.

#### Todoist (studied by R Dheeraj)

Strengths:

1. Use of natural language inputs to add events or tasks.
   a> Use of hashtags to categorize the tasks into their respective archives/folders.
   b> Input words such as everyday and every week can be used to set the timeframe for recurring events.
2. There are color coded priority flags to help users decide on the priority of tasks.
   a> Users can filter tasks based on the priority level and a listed of task will be displayed, sorted by date. 
3. Tasks with no due dates can also be added and viewed. 
4. Apart from filters, users have an option of sorting their tasks by name, priority and date. In the homepage, there will be all the tasks displayed and users can choose their sort options to have a quick view. 
5. Upcoming tasks can also be filtered by their immediacy: today, next 7 days and next month. 
6. Comments/tags can also be added to each tasks. Sometimes, event/task name alone will not be comprehensive. Therefore, users could include description of event/task in the form of comments/tags under each event. 
7. A link with a list of all the shortcut keys for each function has been included. 

Weaknesses:

1. Reminder feature could only be utilized by premium members.
2. Additional features such as backups and productivity trackers are only available in the premium version.

#### Setting the storage location: `setstorage`
Sets the data storage location to the specified file path. <br>
Format: `setstorage FILEPATH`
Examples:
* `setstorage C:\Users\User\Google Drive`
* `setstorage main\tasklist.xml`

> * If the `FILEPATH` does not contain a .xml file at the end, a default .xml file with a default name is appended to the file path.

```
