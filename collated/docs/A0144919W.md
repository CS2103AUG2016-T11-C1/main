### Undo

We added the undo feature to allow the user to undo his last action that modified the list of tasks. This feature uses an undo stack of `UndoInfo` objects to keep track of all mutations that were made to the list of tasks in previous operations performed (commands entered). There is no limit on how many previous operations can be stored in the stack.

For this, we defined a new class called `UndoInfo` that stores three objects:

1. Undo ID: Integer value corresponding to the operation performed (eg. for add, this ID is 1; check UndoCommand.java for a list of all ID's)
2. Filepath: String object; this is only used when the action performed was setstorage. Stores the original filepath prior to performing setstorage.
3. Arraylist of tasks: This is a variable length list, with size dependent on the operation performed. For update, it stores both the new task and the original task. For clear, it stores a list of all the tasks prior to performing clear. For others like add or delete, it just stores the related task.

The information in an `UndoInfo` instance is used to undo the relevant operation based on the undo ID. Example, for undoing an add operation, the task stored in the `UndoInfo` object is deleted, and so on.

### Redo

* Similar to undo, we have the redo operation. This operation can be used only after some changes have been undone, allowing the user to redo those actions. 
* We use a redo stack to store a list of all those `UndoInfo` instances that were popped from the undo stack and pushed into this stack. These changes are redone in a manner similar to how changes are undone in Undo operation. 
* Note that if an operation following an undo operation mutates the list, then the redo stack is cleared at that point.

#### Use case UC03 - Delete task

**MSS**

Precondition: There has to be at least one task for the use to delete.

Guarantees: 
* Event will be deleted from the storage file. 

1. User enters delete command and partial task name.
2. System shows a list of indexed tasks matching the task name.
3. User enters index number of task to be deleted.
4. System deletes the task.
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. None of the existing tasks match the user input.
> 2a1. Use case ends.
 
3a. User cancels task deletion.
> 3a1. Use case ends.

3b. Entered index number is invalid.
> 3b1. System shows an error message.
Use case resumes at step 2.

#### Use case UC04 - Find tasks

**MSS**

Precondition: Only events stored in the storage file can be searched.

1. User enters find command and a keyword.
2. System displays a list of matching tasks.
3. User enters the index of a task from the list.
4. System displays the details of the particular task.

**Extensions**
1a. User enters find command and an index.
> 1a1. Use case jumps to Step 4.

2a. The given keyword is invalid
> 2a1. The system shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at Step 1.

2b. The list is empty
> Use case ends.

4a. User selects invalid task from the list
> 4a1. The system shows an error message <br>
   Use case resumes at Step 3.

#### Use case UC05 - Update task details

**MSS**

Precondition: Task has to exist in the storage file to update. 

Guarantees:  
* The corresponding task details will be updated to their new values. 

1. The user searches for the task (UC04) to be updated. 
2. System displays an indexed list of the task(s). 
3. User enters index of task to be updated, field to be changed and the new value for the field.
4. System stores updates in the storage file and prints message showing the updated entry. 

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty
> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid
> 3a1. The system shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at Step 2

#### Google Calendar (studied by Pankaj Bhootra)

Strengths:

1. User-friendly manner of adding new events and deadlines
2. Acknowledges the important features required by the project (marking a task as 'done', searching for a task by keywords, support for recurring events, quick add feature, etc.)
3. Automatic reminder feature for tasks
4. Categorizes events as "today", "this week" and "this month", etc. which is in line with the project requirement
5. Clear, concise, responsive and efficient UI

Weaknesses:

1. Does not provide support for floating tasks (need to provide a placeholder date/time while adding any task). Also not very good in recording tasks that need to be done before or after a specific date/time.
2. Does not provide CLI (Command Line Interface) for managing tasks
3. Too slow for users who retrieve/edit/store tasks frequently
4. Unavailable in places with no internet connectivity
5. Does not provide the feature to block multiple slots for unconfirmed tasks

#### Updating a task : `update`
Updates information for a task referred by its index.<br>
Format: `update INDEX [TASKNAME] [at/from START_TIMEDATE] [to/by END_TIMEDATE] [r/RECURRING_FREQUENCY] [p/PRIORITY]`

> * Replaces the entered information for the task at the specified index
> * If the newly updated `START_TIMEDATE` exceeds `END_TIMEDATE` of the task, the update will not be successful

Examples:
* `update 1 at 13/09/2016 5pm`<br>

> * `Meeting from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm` will be replaced with `Meeting at 13/09/2016 5pm`

* `update 1 from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm`

> * `Meeting at 13/09/2016 5pm` will be replaced with `Meeting from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm`

* `update 1 p/high`<br>

> * The priority of the task at index 1 is updated to high.

#### Undo previous action(s): `undo`
Undo the latest change made to the task list. <br>

> * There is no limit on the number of times undo can be called, up to the first previous change.

#### Redo previous action(s): `redo`
Redo the latest change that was reverted using undo. <br>
Format: `redo`

> * Allows redo to up to unlimited consecutive undo operations done.
> * Does not work if the undo command was not used just before this command.
