#### Google Calendar (studied by Pankaj Bhootra)

Strengths:

1. User-friendly manner of adding new events and deadlines
2. Acknowledges the important features required by the project (marking a task as 'done', searching for a task by keywords, support for recurring events, quick add feature, etc.)
3. Automatic reminder feature for tasks
4. Categorizes events as "today", "this week" and "this month", etc. which is in line with the project requirement
5. Clear, concise, responsive and efficient UI

Weaknesses:

1. Does not provide support for floating tasks (need to provide a placeholder date/time while adding any task). Also not very good in recording tasks that need to be done before or after a specific date/time.
2. Does not provide CLI (Command Line Interface) for managing tasks
3. Too slow for users who retrieve/edit/store tasks frequently
4. Unavailable in places with no internet connectivity
5. Does not provide the feature to block multiple slots for unconfirmed tasks

Format: `update INDEX [TASKNAME] [at/from [START_TIMEDATE] [to/by [END_TIMEDATE]] [r/RECURRING] [p/PRIORITY]`

> * Replaces the entered information for the task at the specified index
> * If updated START_TIMEDATE exceeds END_TIMEDATE of the task, the update will not be successful

Examples:
* `update 1 at 13/09/2016 5pm`<br>

> * `Meeting from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm` will be replaced with `Meeting at 13/09/2016 5pm`

* `update 1 from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm`

> * `Meeting at 13/09/2016 5pm` will be replaced with `Meeting from 13/09/2016 4pm to 13/09/2016 6pm`
