## How to perform Manual Testing with Sample Data?

1. Copy SampleData.xml file which can be found at `\src\test\data\ManualTesting\SampleData.xml`.
2. Paste the file into the data storage directory (the `data` folder found in the same location as the JAR file `Lazyman's Friend.jar`)
3. Delete the existing XML data file and rename SampleData.xml to the name of this existing XML data file.
